Title:          mirror-enable-https.tcz
Description:    Switch /opt/tcemirror to https when the checks pass.
                Adds the following commands:
                  which-mirror: show the current mirror, supports verbose
                  is-mirror-https: checks if the mirror supports https downloads
                  mirror-enable-https: run at install time to automatically switch
                    the mirror URL in /opt/tcemirror to https when is-mirror-https
                    returns 0. 0 means https, any other code means that it is not.

Comments:       I chose the same dependencies as the current curl.tcz. Maybe less could be enough.
                0.0.2 adds a secondary check: the server may have https, but the extensions
                may only be available in http.
