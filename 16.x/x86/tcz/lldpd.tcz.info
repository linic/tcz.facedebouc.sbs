Comments:	LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant
		proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The
		goal of LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible
		mechanism to deliver Link-Layer notifications to adjacent
		network devices.

		lldpd supports bridge, vlan and bonding.

		_lldpd needs to be added to users and groups to run. The
		lldpdAddUser script checks for user and group _lldpd and adds
		it if not present. The script can be run as a regular user.

		If you want to add the updated user/group related files to your
		/opt/.filetool.lst file, run lldpdBackupUser. The script checks
		if the files are already present before adding them. You must
		then initiate the actual backup yourself.

		To start lldpd:
				sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/lldpd start

		Built with:
		CFLAGS=-flto -fuse-linker-plugin -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -g  -pipe -Wall -Wextra -fno-plt
		LDFLAGS=-Wl,-T/usr/local/lib/ldscripts/elf_i386.xbn
