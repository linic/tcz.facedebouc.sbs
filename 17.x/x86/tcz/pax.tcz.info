overview:	A very robust and versatile package manager for Linux distros
		that enables a user to perform various operations such as:
		copy, extract, download, find which package a file belongs to,
		install/uninstall/unload (different package versions) to
		specified locations, list installed packages, make packages
		(with optional compile step), list dependency trees, validate
		and repair package contents, and open a fifo for network client
		operation.  There's even the ability to proxy several actions
		to a different device!
comments:	This is a more feature full and efficient package manager than
		the default that is included in the TC distro. It can also be
		installed as the default for command line use.
		  [PLANNED UPDATES]
		There are several planned updates that will eventually be
		added. Patches or donations are welcome and will expedite
		future updates. Features include:
		- Concise package listing (instead of current 2 line)
		- An 'html' output option
		- More proxy actions
		- A graphical interface
		- Automated package checking/downloading/updating
		- Ability to search online repos (including server-side)
		- A centralized update server
		- A network server to push/manipulate packages to/on clients
		- Ability to process .deb (and other) package types
		Feature requests can be sent to: service@cliquesoft.org
